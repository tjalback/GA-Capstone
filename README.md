Melbourne On-Street Parking 

As part of my General Assembly Data Analytics Immersive in early 2021, I chose to investigate Melbourne On-Street Parking for my end of course Capstone project.

I wanted to work on a project utilising and devloping my skills to access Open Data, use Python for data extraction, aggregation and analysis and Tableau for visualisation. I was also interested in proposing approaches to remove car parks (say for greening projects, new bike lanes etc), and optimising parking restrictions to reduce violations across the city for visitors/residents. 

I've included a few sample .ipynb files, a PDF presenting a report and I present my project (max 10 minute limit as per project guidelines) here:

Cheers!
